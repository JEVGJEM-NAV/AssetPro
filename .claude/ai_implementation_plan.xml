<!--
    BC AL Development Task Template (New Approach - Skills + Hooks)

    Purpose: Define project-specific context and task requirements

    What this template does:
    ✓ Provides project paths and configuration
    ✓ References external resources (API docs, research)
    ✓ Defines task requirements and acceptance criteria
    ✓ Provides context for Claude to understand the work

    What this template does NOT do:
    ✗ Activate skills (handled by hooks/src/userPromptSubmit.js)
    ✗ Define workflow phases (defined in skills/al-development-core/SKILL.md)
    ✗ Define quality gates (defined in SKILL.md)

    Usage:
    1. Copy this template for each major feature/task
    2. Fill in project_info, external_references, and task sections
    3. Paste into Claude Code when starting work
    4. Hook system will auto-activate appropriate skills

    <current_task>

        <title>Analysis and planning for Asset Pro management application</title>

        <description>
            We need to create plan for Asset Pro management application.
            We take best parts from Rollsberg and generalize them.
            Create list of objects needed with description and requirements.
            In this task we focus on requirements gathering and analysis only.
            Ask questions if something is unclear. Propose solutions, and additional requirements if needed.

                <requirement priority="must">
                    Complete 3 level asset hierarchy. We store assets in levels, levels can be named differently per industry.
                </requirement>
                <requirement priority="should">
                    Potentially unlimited levels of hierarchy. But minimum 3 levels must be supported.

                <requirement priority="must">
                    Asset can belong to customer, location, cost center, vendor. We need to track ownership.

                <requirement priority="must">
                    Asset can be transitioned between locations, customers, cost centers, vendors. Track history.
                    Transition must be made by standard BC documents (Transfer Order, Sales Order, Purchase Order).

                <requirement priority="must">
                    Parts of asset can be tracked as separate assets. E.g. engine of vehicle is asset itself.

                <requirement priority="should">
                    Analyse possibility to link asset movement to Subscription Billing module in BC.
