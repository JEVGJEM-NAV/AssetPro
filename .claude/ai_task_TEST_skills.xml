            This is a test task to verify the hooks and skills auto-loading system.

            TASK OVERVIEW:
            I am planning to develop new Business Central AL extension functionality that will include:
            - Table objects for data storage
            - Page objects for user interface
            - Codeunit objects for business logic
            - Integration with base BC objects through extensions

            DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING.

            INSTEAD, your task is to:

            1. Report which skills were automatically activated by the hooks system
            2. List the skill names and explain why each was activated
            3. Verify that at minimum "al-development-core" skill was loaded
            4. Explain what each loaded skill provides
            5. Confirm the hooks are working correctly

            If skills were NOT automatically loaded:
            - Report that hooks may not be working
            - List what skills SHOULD have been loaded based on the task description
            - Explain what configuration might be missing

            This test should take less than 1 minute to complete.
