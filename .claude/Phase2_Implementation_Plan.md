  2. TestManualHolderChange_BlockedBySetup_ThrowsError - R7 validation
  3. TestManualHolderChange_TransfersChildren - R4 propagation
  4. TestManualHolderChange_BlockedForSubasset - R6 subasset blocking
  5. TestManualHolderChange_InitialHolderAssignment_CreatesEntries - Initial assignment
- ✅ Build: 0 errors, 0 warnings
