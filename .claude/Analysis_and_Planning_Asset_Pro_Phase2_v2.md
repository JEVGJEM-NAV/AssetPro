# Asset Pro - Phase 2 Analysis and Planning Document (v2 - ADJUSTED)

**Project:** Asset Pro - Multi-Industry Asset Management for Business Central
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Asset Transfer and Document Integration
**Publisher:** JEMEL
**Date:** 2025-11-20
**Version:** 2.3 (Manual Holder Change Control Added)
**Status:** Architecture Approved - Ready for Implementation
**Workflow Mode:** Analysis (Relaxed)

---

## Document Changes (v1 → v2 → v2.1 → v2.2 → v2.3)

**Critical Adjustments (v2.0):**

1. **R1 - Posting Date Validation:** Enhanced to prevent backdating and enforce user setup
2. **R2 - Include Children Field:** **REMOVED** - Assets always transfer with children
3. **R3 - Transfer Status Enum:** Simplified to Open/Released only (removed "Posted")
4. **R4 - PostTransferOrder Pattern:** Uses Asset Journal pattern (like BC standard)
5. **R5 - OnDelete Cascade:** Added OnBeforeDelete triggers for cleanup
6. **R6 - Shipment-based Posting:** Assets transfer at Shipment, not Invoice

**Object ID Adjustments (v2.1):**

Due to Phase 1 implementation sessions, the following object IDs are now in use and require adjustment:
- **Table 70182309**: Now used by "JML AP Comment Line" (Phase 1)
- **Table 70182310**: Now used by "JML AP Asset Attr Val Sel" (Phase 1)
- **Enum 70182406**: Now used by "JML AP Component Entry Type" (Phase 1)

**Resolution:**
- All Phase 2 Tables shifted: 70182309-70182326 → **70182311-70182328** (shift +2)
- All Phase 2 Enums shifted: 70182406-70182407 → **70182408-70182409** (shift +2)
- All references throughout document updated accordingly

**Manual Holder Change Control (v2.3):**

Two new requirements added to control direct holder changes on Asset Card:

7. **R7 - Setup Checkbox:** New field "Block Manual Holder Change" in Setup to prevent direct editing of holder fields on Asset Card
8. **R8 - Manual Change Registration:** When manual changes are allowed, they must be automatically registered in Holder Entry ledger

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 extends the Asset Pro foundation (Phase 1) with comprehensive asset transfer capabilities and deep integration with Business Central standard documents. This phase enables complete asset lifecycle management through journals, dedicated transfer documents, and native BC document workflows.

### Phase 1 Foundation Recap

Phase 1 delivered:
- ✅ Asset master table with unlimited classification hierarchy
- ✅ Parent-child asset relationships (physical composition)
- ✅ Current holder tracking (Customer, Vendor, Location)
- ✅ Holder entry ledger with Transfer Out/Transfer In pattern
- ✅ Manual transfer management codeunit
- ✅ Custom attribute framework

### Phase 2 Objectives (Updated)

Phase 2 adds:
1. **Asset Journal** - Batch-based asset holder transfers (uses journal posting pattern)
2. **Asset Transfer Order** - Dedicated document for asset movements (posts via journal)
3. **BC Document Integration** - Asset lines on Sales/Purchase/Transfer Orders (Shipment-based)
4. **Automatic Subasset Propagation** - Children ALWAYS follow parent (no user override)
5. **Parent-Child Relationship Tracking** - Audit trail of attach/detach events
6. **Enhanced Posting Date Validation** - Prevents backdating, enforces user setup

### Key Innovation: Dual Transfer Mechanisms

Asset Pro Phase 2 provides TWO ways to transfer assets, each optimized for different scenarios:

| Mechanism | Use Case | Example | Transfer Timing |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Asset Transfer Order** | Pure asset movements | Internal transfers between locations | On posting |
| **BC Document Integration** | Asset movements with business transactions | Selling asset to customer via Sales Order | **At Shipment** |

## Requirements Analysis (Adjusted)

### R1: Asset Journal (MUST) - **UPDATED**

**Business Need:** Register manual asset holder changes in batch operations.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Batch-based journal lines (like General Journal)
- No journal templates (simplified structure)
- Post multiple asset transfers in single operation
- Create holder entries and update asset master
- Support all holder types (Customer, Vendor, Location)
- **Children ALWAYS transfer with parent** (no user choice)
- Reversing entries deferred to future phase

**Validation Rules (ENHANCED):**
- Asset must exist and not be blocked
- New holder must be different from current holder
- New holder code must exist in respective table
- **Posting date validation:**
  - Cannot be before last entry posting date for this asset (or any subasset)
  - Must be within allowed posting date range (User Setup)
- Cannot transfer subasset independently (must detach first)

**Posting Date Validation Logic:**
```al
procedure ValidatePostingDate(AssetNo: Code[20]; PostingDate: Date)
var
    Asset: Record "JML AP Asset";
    HolderEntry: Record "JML AP Holder Entry";
    UserSetup: Record "User Setup";
    ChildAsset: Record "JML AP Asset";
    MaxPostingDate: Date;
begin
    Asset.Get(AssetNo);

    // Check last entry date for this asset
    HolderEntry.SetRange("Asset No.", AssetNo);
    if HolderEntry.FindLast() then
        MaxPostingDate := HolderEntry."Posting Date";

    // Check last entry date for all subassets (recursive)
    ChildAsset.SetRange("Parent Asset No.", AssetNo);
    if ChildAsset.FindSet() then
        repeat
            HolderEntry.SetRange("Asset No.", ChildAsset."No.");
            if HolderEntry.FindLast() then
                if HolderEntry."Posting Date" > MaxPostingDate then
                    MaxPostingDate := HolderEntry."Posting Date";
            // Recursive check for grandchildren...
        until ChildAsset.Next() = 0;

    // Validate not before max date
    if PostingDate < MaxPostingDate then
        Error('Posting date %1 cannot be before last entry date %2 for asset %3 or its children',
            PostingDate, MaxPostingDate, AssetNo);

    // Check user allowed posting date range
    if UserSetup.Get(UserId) then begin
        if UserSetup."Allow Posting From" <> 0D then
            if PostingDate < UserSetup."Allow Posting From" then
                Error('Posting date %1 is before allowed range start date %2',
                    PostingDate, UserSetup."Allow Posting From");

        if UserSetup."Allow Posting To" <> 0D then
            if PostingDate > UserSetup."Allow Posting To" then
                Error('Posting date %1 is after allowed range end date %2',
                    PostingDate, UserSetup."Allow Posting To");
    end;
end;
```

---

### R2: Asset Transfer Order (MUST) - **UPDATED**

**Business Need:** Document-based asset transfers with audit trail and workflow support.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Header/Lines document structure
- Support unlimited assets per document
- From Holder → To Holder pattern
- Single-step posting (**via Asset Journal pattern**)
- Posted document archive with complete history
- **Children ALWAYS included** (no user choice at line level)
- Status flow: Open → Released → Posted (to archive)
- Document numbering with no gaps

**Validation Rules:**
- Document must be Released before posting
- All assets must be valid and not blocked
- From Holder must match asset's current holder
- To Holder must be different from From Holder
- Cannot post empty document (must have lines)
- **Posting date validation** (same as R1)

**Posting Pattern (CRITICAL CHANGE):**
```al
procedure PostTransferOrder(var AssetTransferHeader: Record "JML AP Asset Transfer Header")
var
    AssetJournalBatch: Record "JML AP Asset Journal Batch";
    AssetJournalLine: Record "JML AP Asset Journal Line";
    AssetTransferLine: Record "JML AP Asset Transfer Line";
    AssetJnlPost: Codeunit "JML AP Asset Jnl.-Post";
begin
    // 1. Validate document
    CheckTransferOrder(AssetTransferHeader);

    // 2. Get system journal batch (like BC uses "POSTING" batch)
    GetSystemJournalBatch(AssetJournalBatch);

    // 3. Create journal lines from transfer lines
    AssetTransferLine.SetRange("Document No.", AssetTransferHeader."No.");
    if AssetTransferLine.FindSet() then
        repeat
            CreateJournalLine(AssetJournalBatch, AssetTransferLine, AssetTransferHeader);
        until AssetTransferLine.Next() = 0;

    // 4. Post journal (creates holder entries)
    AssetJournalLine.SetRange("Journal Batch Name", AssetJournalBatch.Name);
    AssetJnlPost.Run(AssetJournalLine);

    // 5. Create posted document
    CreatePostedTransferDocument(AssetTransferHeader);

    // 6. Delete source document
    AssetTransferLine.DeleteAll(true);
    AssetTransferHeader.Delete(true);
end;
```

**Why Journal Pattern?**
- ✅ Follows BC standard (Sales→Gen.Jnl, Purchase→Gen.Jnl, Transfer→Item.Jnl)
- ✅ Single validation point (Asset Journal validates all posting)
- ✅ Reusable posting logic
- ✅ Consistent with BC architecture
- ✅ Extensible via event subscribers

---

### R3: BC Document Integration (MUST) - **UPDATED: SHIPMENT-BASED**

**Business Need:** Transfer assets within standard BC business processes (Sales, Purchasing, Transfers).

**Functional Requirements:**
- Separate asset line tables (not mixed with standard lines)
- Asset lines on Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Transfer Orders
- **Assets transfer at SHIPMENT** (physical movement), not invoice
- Support asset-only documents (shipment without invoice)
- Block document posting if asset transfer fails
- Leverage BC warehouse/picking workflows
- Posted asset lines linked to **Posted Shipment/Receipt** documents

**Key Scenarios:**
- **Sales Order with assets:** Sell equipment to customer
  - Post Shipment → Asset holder changes to customer
  - Post Invoice later → No asset movement (already shipped)

- **Purchase Order with assets:** Acquire equipment from vendor
  - Post Receipt → Asset holder changes from vendor to our location
  - Post Invoice later → No asset movement (already received)

- **Transfer Order with assets:** Move assets between locations
  - Post Shipment → Asset leaves source location
  - Post Receipt → Asset arrives at destination location

- **Asset-only Sales Shipment:** Use Sales Order workflow (picking, shipping) for asset transfer without financial transaction

**Shipment-based Posting:**
When document posts shipment:
- Create Posted Shipment/Receipt header
- Create Posted Shipment/Receipt Asset Lines
- Create asset holder entries (Transfer Out + Transfer In)
- Update asset Current Holder
- Track "Quantity Shipped" per asset line (0 or 1)

When document posts invoice (later):
- Create Posted Invoice header
- NO asset lines (already shipped)
- NO asset holder entries (already transferred)
- Standard financial posting only

---

### R4: Automatic Subasset Propagation (MUST) - **SIMPLIFIED**

**Business Need:** Maintain data consistency - child assets must follow parent asset location.

**Functional Requirements (SIMPLIFIED):**
- **ALWAYS automatic** - no user choice to exclude children
- Unlimited recursion depth (no artificial limit)
- Prevent circular references (already implemented in Phase 1)
- Each asset gets separate holder entry (full audit trail)
- Transaction No. links parent and children transfers

**Business Logic:**
```
Transfer Vehicle (Parent) to Customer A
  → Automatically transfer Engine (Child) to Customer A
    → Automatically transfer Turbocharger (Grandchild) to Customer A
      → Continue recursively for ALL descendants
```

**User Workflow:**
- **Want children to move with parent?** → Just transfer parent (automatic)
- **Want child to move independently?** → **First Detach** child from parent, then transfer

**No "Include Children" Field:**
- ❌ Removed from Asset Journal Line
- ❌ Removed from Asset Transfer Line
- ❌ Removed from Sales/Purchase/Transfer Asset Lines
- ✅ Behavior is ALWAYS "with children"
- ✅ Simplifies logic, prevents confusion

---

### R5: Parent-Child Relationship Tracking (MUST)

**Business Need:** Audit trail of asset composition changes over time.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Log every Attach event (asset becomes child of parent)
- Log every Detach event (asset freed from parent)
- Capture holder information at moment of attach/detach
- Reason code supported (optional)
- Answer historical questions: "What components were in Vehicle V-001 on 2024-01-15?"

**Use Cases:**
- Audit: "When was this engine installed in the vehicle?"
- Compliance: "Track component history for regulated equipment"
- Analysis: "How long do components typically stay in parent assets?"

---

### R6: Subasset Movement Restriction (MUST)

**Business Need:** Prevent data inconsistency from independent child asset movements.

**Functional Requirements:**
- **Hard block:** Cannot transfer asset with Parent Asset No. populated
- Error message: "Cannot transfer subasset [Asset No.]. It is attached to parent [Parent No.]. Detach first."
- **Detach action:** Button on Asset Card to clear Parent Asset No.
- Detach requires optional reason code
- Detach creates Relationship Entry (type = Detach)
- After detach, asset can be transferred independently
- Re-attach supported (sets Parent Asset No., creates Relationship Entry type = Attach)

---

### R7: Manual Holder Change Control (MUST) - **NEW**

**Business Need:** Provide administrators with control over whether users can directly edit holder fields on the Asset Card, or must use formal transfer processes (journals/documents).

**Functional Requirements:**

**Setup Configuration:**
- New field in Table 70182300 "JML AP Asset Setup": `Block Manual Holder Change` (Boolean)
- Default value: `false` (allows manual changes for backward compatibility)
- Visible on Setup page with clear description

**Asset Card Behavior:**

When `Block Manual Holder Change = true`:
- Fields `Current Holder Type` and `Current Holder Code` become non-editable on Asset Card
- Fields remain editable = false on Asset List
- Attempting to modify via code triggers error: "Direct holder changes are blocked. Use Asset Journal or Transfer Orders."
- Holder changes ONLY allowed through:
  - Asset Journal (Table 70182312)
  - Asset Transfer Order (Table 70182313)
  - BC Document Integration (Sales/Purchase/Transfer Orders)

When `Block Manual Holder Change = false`:
- Fields `Current Holder Type` and `Current Holder Code` remain editable
- Manual changes trigger **automatic ledger registration** (see R8)
- Provides flexibility for simple scenarios or data corrections

**Validation Logic:**
```al
trigger OnValidate() // on Current Holder Type/Code fields
var
    AssetSetup: Record "JML AP Asset Setup";
begin
    AssetSetup.Get();
    if AssetSetup."Block Manual Holder Change" then
        Error('Direct holder changes are blocked by setup. Use Asset Journal or Transfer Orders to change holders.');

    // If allowed, proceed with R8 logic (automatic registration)
end;
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Strict Control:** Large organizations requiring audit trail and approval workflow → Enable blocking
- **Flexible Data Management:** Small organizations or during initial setup → Allow manual changes
- **Data Corrections:** Temporarily disable blocking for corrections, then re-enable

---

### R8: Manual Holder Change Registration (MUST) - **NEW**

**Business Need:** When manual holder changes are permitted, automatically create holder entries to maintain complete audit trail.

**Functional Requirements:**

**Automatic Registration Trigger:**
When user modifies `Current Holder Type` or `Current Holder Code` on Asset Card (and `Block Manual Holder Change = false`):
- Automatically call Transfer Management to create holder entries
- Use Document Type = "Manual"
- Document No. = System-generated or user-provided reference
- Posting Date = WORKDATE by default (user can specify)
- Reason Code = Optional

**Implementation Pattern:**
```al
// In Table 70182301 "JML AP Asset"
trigger OnModify()
var
    AssetSetup: Record "JML AP Asset Setup";
    AssetTransferMgt: Codeunit "JML AP Transfer Mgt";
    OldHolderType: Enum "JML AP Holder Type";
    OldHolderCode: Code[20];
begin
    AssetSetup.Get();

    // Only auto-register if manual changes are allowed
    if not AssetSetup."Block Manual Holder Change" then begin
        // Detect holder change
        if (xRec."Current Holder Type" <> "Current Holder Type") or
           (xRec."Current Holder Code" <> "Current Holder Code") then begin

            // Store old values
            OldHolderType := xRec."Current Holder Type";
            OldHolderCode := xRec."Current Holder Code";

            // Validate new holder exists
            ValidateHolderExists("Current Holder Type", "Current Holder Code");

            // Create holder entries via Transfer Management
            RegisterManualHolderChange(
                OldHolderType,
                OldHolderCode,
                "Current Holder Type",
                "Current Holder Code");
        end;
    end;
end;

local procedure RegisterManualHolderChange(
    OldHolderType: Enum "JML AP Holder Type";
    OldHolderCode: Code[20];
    NewHolderType: Enum "JML AP Holder Type";
    NewHolderCode: Code[20])
var
    HolderEntry: Record "JML AP Holder Entry";
    NextEntryNo: Integer;
    TransactionNo: Integer;
begin
    // Get next transaction number
    if HolderEntry.FindLast() then begin
        NextEntryNo := HolderEntry."Entry No." + 1;
        TransactionNo := HolderEntry."Transaction No." + 1;
    end else begin
        NextEntryNo := 1;
        TransactionNo := 1;
    end;

    // Create Transfer Out entry (old holder)
    HolderEntry.Init();
    HolderEntry."Entry No." := NextEntryNo;
    HolderEntry."Transaction No." := TransactionNo;
    HolderEntry."Asset No." := "No.";
    HolderEntry."Entry Type" := HolderEntry."Entry Type"::"Transfer Out";
    HolderEntry."Holder Type" := OldHolderType;
    HolderEntry."Holder Code" := OldHolderCode;
    HolderEntry."Posting Date" := WorkDate();
    HolderEntry."Document Type" := "JML AP Document Type"::Manual;
    HolderEntry."Document No." := 'MANUAL-' + Format(CurrentDateTime, 0, '<Year4><Month,2><Day,2><Hours24><Minutes,2><Seconds,2>');
    HolderEntry."User ID" := UserId;
    HolderEntry."Description" := StrSubstNo('Manual holder change on Asset Card');
    HolderEntry.Insert(true);

    // Create Transfer In entry (new holder)
    NextEntryNo += 1;
    HolderEntry.Init();
    HolderEntry."Entry No." := NextEntryNo;
    HolderEntry."Transaction No." := TransactionNo;
    HolderEntry."Asset No." := "No.";
    HolderEntry."Entry Type" := HolderEntry."Entry Type"::"Transfer In";
    HolderEntry."Holder Type" := NewHolderType;
    HolderEntry."Holder Code" := NewHolderCode;
    HolderEntry."Posting Date" := WorkDate();
    HolderEntry."Document Type" := "JML AP Document Type"::Manual;
    HolderEntry."Document No." := 'MANUAL-' + Format(CurrentDateTime, 0, '<Year4><Month,2><Day,2><Hours24><Minutes,2><Seconds,2>');
    HolderEntry."User ID" := UserId;
    HolderEntry."Description" := StrSubstNo('Manual holder change on Asset Card');
    HolderEntry.Insert(true);

    // Update "Current Holder Since"
    "Current Holder Since" := WorkDate();
end;
```

**Validation Rules:**
- New holder must exist in respective master table
- New holder must be different from old holder
- If asset has children and subasset propagation is enabled, create entries for children too
- Posting date follows same validation as Asset Journal (no backdating)

**User Experience:**
1. User opens Asset Card
2. User changes `Current Holder Type` from "Location" to "Customer"
3. User selects Customer No. "C-10000"
4. User clicks OK or moves to next field
5. **System automatically:**
   - Creates Transfer Out entry (from old Location)
   - Creates Transfer In entry (to Customer C-10000)
   - Updates "Current Holder Since" to today
   - Shows confirmation message: "Holder change registered. 2 entries created."
6. User can view entries in Holder Entries page

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Complete audit trail even for manual changes
- ✅ No "orphan" holder changes without ledger entries
- ✅ Consistent with formal transfer processes
- ✅ Supports compliance and auditing requirements

## Component 3: BC Document Integration (MAJOR UPDATE - SHIPMENT-BASED)

### Architecture Pattern

**Shipment-based Asset Transfer:**
- Assets transfer when document posts **Shipment/Receipt**
- Invoice posting does NOT transfer assets (already moved)
- Separate asset line tables for Shipment and Receipt documents

### Tables (UPDATED - NEW TABLES ADDED)

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ **REMOVED** separate `TransferAsset` procedure (without children)
- ✅ **ALWAYS** calls recursive transfer
- ✅ **NO** conditional logic based on user choice
- ✅ **Added** PostingDate parameter throughout

## Component 5: Parent-Child Relationship Tracking

(No changes from v1 - this component is still correct)

---

## Component 6: Subasset Movement Restriction

(No changes from v1 - this component is still correct)

---

## Component 7: Asset Management Role Center (NEW)

### Business Need

Provide Asset Managers with a dedicated workspace that:
- Centralizes all Asset Pro functionality in one place
- Displays real-time KPIs through tiles
- Enables quick access to common tasks
- Follows BC role center best practices

### Functional Requirements

**Role Center Page:**
- Headline with dynamic KPIs (Total Assets, Open Transfers, Recent Transfers)
- Cues (Tiles) for quick insights
- Activities section with quick links to common tasks
- Reports section with standard reports
- Setup/Admin section (conditional visibility based on permissions)

**Cues (Tiles):**
1. **Total Assets** - Count of all non-blocked assets
2. **Assets by Holder Type** - Breakdown (Customer, Vendor, Location)
3. **Open Transfer Orders** - Count of unreleased transfer orders
4. **Released Transfer Orders** - Count ready to post
5. **Today's Transfers** - Holder entries created today
6. **This Week's Transfers** - Holder entries created this week
7. **Assets with Children** - Assets that have subassets attached
8. **Orphan Assets** - Assets without classification or holder

**Activities (Quick Links):**
- Asset List
- Asset Journal
- Asset Transfer Orders
- Posted Asset Transfers
- Holder Entries
- Relationship Entries
- Asset Classifications

**Reports (Quick Links):**
- Asset List Report
- Holder Entries Report
- Asset Transfer History
- Assets by Classification
- Assets by Current Holder

**Setup (Admin Only):**
- Asset Pro Setup
- Asset Classifications
- Number Series Setup
